Geographic and Financial Impact of Carbon Tax on USA

This is the repository for our Big Data Project at Columbia University (<a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~cylin/course/bigdata/">EECS E6893</a>).



>The United States has a much greater geographic distribution of people than other industrialized nations and a significant percentage of commuters (people who travel long distances to work). This research will look at the geographic and financial impact of a carbon tax on suburban areas. We will look at commuting distance data utilizing standard online mapping tools. We will then construct multiple distance-dependent commuting models combined with population date from the census to estimate commuters. 

>We will then use apply a set of carbon tax measures to the data including to ones similar to Washington State's Initiative 732 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Initiative_732) and Kyoto protocal levels (http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg3/index.php?idp=37). The financial impact of the tax will then be investigated by comparing to income data (also from the census). 

>The expected outcome is that carbon tax will disproportionately impact large cities with high commuting populations. Additionally, the impact of in terms of % of income will be even more significant. Or not. 

>This research was inspired by: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es4034364 

>Languages: Python/Spark or System G
>Dataset: Combine multiple data sets. Scrape distance data using Google Maps and other mapping software. Population and income data from census sources. 
>Analytics: Spark and/or System G
